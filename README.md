# Numbers API
Just me messing around with Python and API calls. This program is connected to a very cool open API which takes in a request with a number and then returns with a fact about that given number. Simple, basic but cool!

# How It Works
- Program connects to API endpoint at http://numbersapi.com/
- A response object makes a GET request to that endpoint.
- If the user for some reason doesn't input a whole number (integer), the program will nicely let him/her know and then generate a random number itself and give a fact to them about that random generated number.
